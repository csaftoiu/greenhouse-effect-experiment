Figure 3: Thermal radiation transmission through optical materials from a 65°C graybody (ε=0.9). The top plot shows transmission percentages for borosilicate glass and CaF₂ (left y-axis), along with the graybody spectral radiance (right y-axis, dashed line). The bottom plot shows the graybody emission spectrum and the resulting transmitted radiation through each material. Total percentages represent the ratio of transmitted radiation to total graybody emission across all wavelengths according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law.
