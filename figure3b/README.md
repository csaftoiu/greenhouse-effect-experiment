# Figure 2: Temperature vs. Insolation by Pane Configuration

This directory contains the code and data needed to generate Figure 2 of the paper.

## Description

Figure 2 presents the relationship between peak temperature and insolation measurements for different experimental pane configurations. It displays both total insolation and the insolation reaching the bottom for each configuration, along with error bars and clear labeling.

## Files

- `plot_figure2.py`: Main script to generate the figure
- `data/figure2_data.csv`: Data for the plot (generated by the script)
- `data/figure2_caption.txt`: Generated caption for the figure

## How to Run

To generate Figure 2, run the following command from within this directory:

```bash
python plot_figure2.py
```

This will:
1. Generate the data file containing all the measurements
2. Create the publication-quality plot with all annotations
3. Save the figure as `figure2.png`
4. Save the caption as `data/figure2_caption.txt`

## Configuration Legend

The figure includes various pane configurations labeled as follows:
- `----`: Uncovered (no panes)
- `CCCC`: All calcium fluoride panes
- `BCCC`: One borosilicate pane, three calcium fluoride panes
- `BBCC`: Two borosilicate panes, two calcium fluoride panes
- `BBBB`: All borosilicate panes
