# Experimental Data Analysis and Visualization

This repository contains code to generate and analyze data from experiments on thermal radiation transmission through different optical materials. The codebase is organized into three main sections, each corresponding to a figure in the paper.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into a directory for each figure, plus a `raw_data` directory.

Each directory contains:
- Python scripts to generate the corresponding figure
- Data files needed for analysis
- Pre-generated figures

## Required Dependencies

The code requires the following Python packages:
- numpy
- matplotlib
- pandas
- scipy

You can install all dependencies with:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib pandas scipy
```
